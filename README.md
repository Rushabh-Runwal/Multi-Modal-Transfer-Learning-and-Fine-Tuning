# üß† Multi-Modal Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning

This repository contains my Google Colab notebooks and detailed video walkthroughs for the **Multi-Modal Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Assignment**.

In this project, I explore how to leverage **existing pretrained models** and fine-tune them across **various data modalities**, including pose detection, crop disease detection, video classification, sound/audio classification, image segmentation, text-to-image generation, and more.
